### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Altynai, originally from Kyrgyzstan and currently residing in Turkey. I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering and am currently working as a front-end developer at a company here. I really enjoy learning and constantly exploring new horizons in the tech world. ( I am trying.) :)

During my free time, I'm developing personal projects to enhance my skills. My primary focus is on improving my knowledge of React, and I'm learning React Native, which is a fantastic experience.

While my GitHub page may not boast an extensive portfolio at the moment, I'm committed to creating more interesting projects. I'm on a continuous path of personal and professional growth and improvement. Stay tuned for more exciting updates!
